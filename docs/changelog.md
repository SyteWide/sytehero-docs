# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to SyteHero are documented here.
Uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format with **Added** / **Changed** / **Fixed** / **Removed** buckets.

---

## v1.0.062 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Theme/framework auto-detection now recognizes Elementor when it's installed as a plugin**, even on Avada- or Divi-themed sites. Previously, an Avada site with Elementor active would auto-detect as `Avada` — so SyteHero's inline sizer would hunt for `.fusion-column-wrapper` ancestors that never exist inside an Elementor page, and the hero wrapper wouldn't receive its sizing tokens. Fresh installs now default to `Elementor` on those mixed setups. Existing sites can re-run detection from **SyteHero → Settings → Detect** (or override manually via the Theme dropdown).

### Added
- **`sytehero/is_elementor_plugin_active` filter** — override SyteHero's Elementor plugin detection. Useful if you want to force a theme-based profile even when Elementor is active (e.g., an Avada site where Elementor is installed but only used on a handful of pages managed by the SyteHero Avada widget). Receives the bootstrap-derived boolean and must return a boolean.

---

## v1.0.061 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Elementor builder canvas: hero no longer collapses to 0 px.** The scaffold wrap/stage layers that wrap every builder widget's slider did not carry a min-height, so the absolutely-positioned `.sytehero-fhsbg` slider had no sized containing block and disappeared inside the Elementor canvas. The scaffold now propagates the same min-height formula the outer-wrapper sizer uses, scoped with `:has(.sytehero-fhsbg)` so non-hero widgets still flow at their natural height. Same fix applies silently to Avada, Divi, and Gutenberg scaffolds.

### Added
- **Builder widgets detect the viewport's breakpoint automatically.** Elementor, Avada Fusion, Divi, and Gutenberg SyteHero widgets now opt into reactive breakpoint detection — the wrapper's `sytehero-hero-featured--{desktop|tablet|mobile}` class tracks the viewport via `matchMedia`, so authors no longer need to hand-pick a view per breakpoint or render per-view variants. Elementor's own breakpoint config is honored when present (so changing tablet to 900 px in Site Settings → Layout flows through automatically). Plain `[sytehero_featured]` / `[sytehero_custom]` shortcodes placed outside a builder widget keep the existing fixed-view behavior.
- **`sytehero/breakpoints` filter** — pin custom viewport thresholds site-wide without editing core. Receives `( array $breakpoints, string $theme_key )` and must return `[ 'mobile_max' => int, 'tablet_max' => int ]`. Defaults follow each theme's own conventions (Elementor 767/1024, Avada 640/1024, Divi 767/980, generic 767/1024).

### Changed
- **Heads-up for custom CSS authors.** On pages rendered through a SyteHero builder widget (Elementor / Avada Fusion / Divi / Gutenberg), the hero wrapper's view class (`.sytehero-hero-featured--desktop|--tablet|--mobile`) now tracks the visitor's viewport instead of staying pinned to whatever view the widget was configured for. If you have site CSS that assumes a stable `--desktop` class on a placement, that rule will unselect on mobile/tablet viewports. To restore the old "always desktop" behavior on a specific placement, target by the widget-specific wrapper class instead (e.g., `.sytehero-scaffold-wrap--elementor`, or a custom class you add via the widget's "Extra wrapper CSS class" field). Plain shortcode calls outside a builder widget are unaffected.

### Internal
- Inline sizer script de-duplicated into `Syte\Hero\Frontend\SliderSizerScript` — both `[sytehero_featured]` and `[sytehero_custom]` now emit byte-identical sizing JS, and the helper has dedicated unit-test coverage (11 tests).
- Elementor live-config read hardened: the resolver now checks `window.elementorFrontend.config.responsive.activeBreakpoints` (Elementor 3.4+), `window.elementorFrontend.config.responsive.breakpoints` (3.2–3.3), and the raw `window.elementorFrontendConfig.responsive.{activeBreakpoints,breakpoints}` fallback, so user-overridden Elementor breakpoints propagate regardless of load order.

---

## v1.0.060 — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Builder profile-override system hardened.** The 4 builder integrations (Avada Fusion, Divi, Elementor, Gutenberg) that override the active theme injection profile during their render now share a single `RenderProfileScope` helper that wraps `add_filter` / `do_shortcode` / `remove_filter` in a try/finally. If the shortcode chain throws (license check, repository query, theme adapter), the override is no longer leaked past the render — preventing silent corruption of subsequent slider renders on the same page request.
- **Gutenberg block override now covers all three injection selectors** (`overlay_wrapper_selector`, `text_host_selector`, `cta_text_selector`) instead of only the wrapper. On sites where SyteHero is set to a host theme like Avada, the Gutenberg block's overlay text and CTA injection no longer try to find Avada-specific selectors (`.fusion-text`, `.fusion-button-text`) inside the host-theme-agnostic block scaffold.
- **Theme keys exposed as constants** on `ThemeConfig` (`THEME_KEY_AVADA`, `THEME_KEY_DIVI`, `THEME_KEY_ELEMENTOR`) so builder integrations don't repeat magic-string keys that a future refactor could silently drift from.

### Fixed
- **`ServiceContainer::get_active_theme_injection_profile()` now type-guards** the resolved theme adapter's return value. A misbehaving custom adapter that returns a non-array (object, null, scalar) now falls back to the global `ThemeConfig` instead of corrupting the downstream shortcode chain.
- **Frontend slider JS fallback chain reordered** for clarity. Builder-specific selectors (`.elementor-widget-container`, `.e-con`, `.et_pb_column`, `.sytehero-scaffold-wrap`) are tried first; the `[data-sytehero-hero-wrapper]` data attribute is now last because it's only set by the inline sizer that has already failed by the time we reach the fallback.

### Added
- **Public `Syte\\Hero\\Integrations\\Scaffold\\RenderProfileScope`** helper class. Two static methods: `with_override( callable $override, callable $body )` for exception-safe profile substitution during a render, and `force_theme( string $theme_key )` to build a fixed-profile override callable from a `ThemeConfig::THEME_KEY_*` constant. Available for any custom integration that needs the same scoped-override behavior.
- **10 new unit tests** covering the filter contract: `RenderProfileScopeTest` (7 tests, including try/finally cleanup on body exception) and `ServiceContainerProfileFilterTest` (3 tests covering the filter wiring + non-array result guard). PHPUnit suite is now 1230 tests / 3720 assertions.

---

## v1.0.059 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **All builder integrations now use their own theme profile during render**, not just Elementor (v1.0.058). The same root cause that collapsed Elementor heroes to a sliver — the inline sizer using whichever profile the global SyteHero setting selected — would have surfaced any time a builder integration was used on a site whose SyteHero theme didn't match. Each builder now owns its rendering context:
  - **Avada Fusion element** forces the Avada profile (`.fusion-column-wrapper`).
  - **Divi module** forces the Divi profile (`.et_pb_column`).
  - **Elementor widget** continues to force the Elementor profile (`.elementor-widget-container` chain).
  - **Gutenberg block** sizes against the scaffold's own wrapper (`.sytehero-scaffold-wrap`) so the block works in any host theme without depending on theme-specific column structure.

---

## v1.0.058 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Elementor pages: SyteHero hero now renders at full size** instead of collapsing to a small square in the corner. The shortcode's inline sizing CSS/JS was hardcoded to the globally-selected SyteHero theme (typically Avada's `.fusion-column-wrapper`), which doesn't exist inside an Elementor widget — leaving the absolutely-positioned slider with no parent height. The Elementor widget now overrides the active injection profile during its render, and the frontend slider JS falls back to the closest `.elementor-widget-container` / `.e-con` / `[data-sytehero-hero-wrapper]` when the configured selector doesn't match. Sites that use SyteHero in mixed-builder contexts (e.g. Avada theme with Elementor pages) will see the hero render correctly in both.
- **Save Image Details: preview at the top now reliably appears with the actual generated image.** In the non-deferred save flow, the modal opened the dialog before the image URL had been fetched, so the preview block stayed empty. The flow now fetches the preview URL before opening the dialog, falls back to reading the rendered result `<img>` element when state is empty, and always renders the preview wrapper as a stable visual anchor.
- **Discard button is now always visible** in the Save Image Details dialog — including in studio mode where no attachment exists yet. In the no-attachment case, Discard simply resets the in-flight generation and closes the dialog so users can re-prompt; in preset-tool mode it still deletes the auto-saved attachment from the media library.
- **Modal no longer auto-closes after saving SEO metadata.** Previously, completing a non-deferred save closed the entire modal, removing the user's chance to review the saved image, regenerate, or apply it. The modal now stays open after save so the user can decide what to do next.

### Added
- **`sytehero_active_theme_injection_profile` filter** lets renderers temporarily substitute the active theme injection profile for the duration of a single shortcode render. Used by the Elementor widget to force its own profile on Avada-themed sites; available for any custom integration that needs the same.

---

## v1.0.057 — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Save Image Details now shows a preview of the generated image** at the top of the dialog, so you can see exactly what you're about to save before filling in title/alt/caption/description.
- **"Discard" button in Save Image Details** for AI Studio's preset tools (Extend to Fit, Remove Background) where the generated image is auto-saved to the Media Library before the dialog opens. Clicking Discard prompts for confirmation, then deletes the attachment so you don't have to clean up unwanted images by hand. The original source image is preserved so you can immediately retry. If the image is already in use elsewhere on the site, Discard surfaces a friendly inline message instead of force-deleting. (Studio mode hides the button entirely — Cancel still works there because nothing was saved yet.)
- **`sytehero_fal_outpaint_guardrail_prompt` filter** for agencies and developers who want to tune the outpaint guardrail phrasing per-site without forking. Receives `( string $prompt, string $image_url, string $user_prompt )`.

### Changed
- **Extend-to-Fit Aspect Ratio panel spacing has been refined.** The description, the "Extend to &lt;ratio&gt;" button, and the optional fill-prompt input now have proper visual hierarchy — the button reads as the primary action and the prompt is visually separated as an optional refinement.
- **Outpaint (Extend to Fit) now reliably matches the original background.** A guardrail instruction is automatically prepended to every outpaint request asking the model to seamlessly extend the existing scene and avoid introducing unrelated objects, text, or scenery. Your custom fill-prompt (if any) is appended as additional direction. The fill-prompt placeholder and an inline tip have been updated to reflect this.
- **Elementor editor placeholder for the SyteHero Hero Slider widget now shows the human-readable source name** (e.g. "Featured Products slider", "Custom Hero: Spring Sale") instead of the raw slug.

### Fixed
- **Elementor editor canvas no longer loses scroll when the SyteHero Hero Slider widget is added.** The featured-products slider's positioning and touch handlers were trapping wheel/touch events inside Elementor's preview iframe. The widget now renders a static placeholder when in edit mode (the live slider still renders normally on the published page), the slider's frontend JS bails early if it detects Elementor edit mode, and a defensive CSS reset neutralises the slider's `overflow:hidden`/`position:absolute` whenever Elementor's editor body class is present — so even hero markup that lands in the editor through other paths (HTML/shortcode widgets, cached templates) can no longer trap scroll.

---

## v1.0.056 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dragging an image into the AI Studio source area now reliably selects it.** A follow-up to v1.0.055 addressing two stacked issues: the uploader falls back through `sizes.medium.url → url → guid` (and logs a warning if none are usable), and the thumbnail `<img>` retries with the full-size URL when its subsize variant (e.g. `-229x300.jpg`) fails to load. If both variants fail (the rare case where the upload response URL points to a different origin that hasn't yet received the file), the drop zone restores its placeholder and surfaces an "Upload failed" hint instead of silently collapsing. Fix spans every AI Studio modal — AI Studio, Remove Background, Extend to Fit, Upscale, Image-to-Video, Hero generator.

### Added
- **"Processing…" spinner in the source image drop zone during upload.** Dropping an image (or using the AI Studio "Upload File" button) now shows a centred spinner and a pulsing accent border while the file is uploading, so the zone never looks unresponsive between drop and selection. The AI Copy Reference image tile gets an equivalent spinner overlay. Copy is localizable via `SyteHero.i18n.aiSourceProcessing` / `aiSourceUploading` / `aiSourceUploadFailed`.
- **Drag-and-drop on the AI Copy modal's Reference image tile.** The tile already accepted click-to-pick via the Media Library; it now also accepts a dropped image file, mirroring the behaviour of every other image input in AI Studio.

### Changed
- **"Extend to Fit Aspect Ratio" now sits directly under the Quality selector** inside the generation options, instead of appearing as a standalone row above the prompt. Keeps the option visually grouped with the other generation controls where users expect it.

---

## v1.0.055 — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Unified drop-zone placeholder wording across AI tool modals.** The per-tool modals (Remove Background, Extend to Fit, Upscale, Image-to-Video) now read "Drop or click" to match the hero and AI Studio modals, replacing the longer "Drop or click to select image" for a consistent drop-target affordance.

---

## v1.0.054 — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **"Unexpected status: in_progress" error on slow AI generations.** The AI image modals were only recognising fal.ai status codes in their legacy uppercase form, so when a model stayed in progress long enough to be re-polled (common with Nano Banana Pro), the UI bailed out with an error. Poll handlers now normalise the response so either uppercase or lowercase statuses round-trip cleanly.
- **Drag-and-drop uploads into the AI Studio modal no longer vanish.** Previously the dropped file uploaded to the Media Library but never appeared in the source area unless the Media Library picker had been opened first. The drop handler is now wired to the same state-update path as click-to-select, so the thumbnail updates immediately.
- **AI Studio "Upload File" button now shows the image straight away.** Same class of bug as the drag-drop case: if a user clicked Upload File before ever opening the Media Library picker, the file uploaded but the thumb stayed empty. It now routes through the base modal's shared selection handler.

### Added
- **Drag-and-drop is now available in every AI modal.** The hero image generator, AI Studio, and the per-tool modals (Remove Background, Extend to Fit, Upscale, Image-to-Video) all accept an image file dropped onto their source area in addition to click-to-pick. The placeholder now reads "Drop or click to select" as a visible hint.

### Changed
- **"Extend to Fit" is now a collapsed dropdown instead of an always-visible row.** It used to appear automatically whenever the source image's aspect ratio didn't match the target, which confused users unfamiliar with outpainting. It now only appears when your source actually doesn't match the selected ratio, shows up collapsed by default, and carries a discreet "Recommended — your source doesn't match…" hint next to the summary. Opening it reveals the optional fill prompt and "Extend to &lt;ratio&gt;" button. The Extend to Fit tool modal keeps the dropdown auto-expanded since it's the tool's primary action.

---

## v1.0.053 — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Scaffold wrapper discovery simplified.** `sytehero-frontend-overlay.js` now recognises `.sytehero-scaffold-wrap` as the overlay wrapper directly, short-circuiting the theme-profile walk-up when a builder widget is present. The scaffold no longer needs to carry `.e-con` (or any theme-specific class) to be discoverable, and the Elementor builder path stops emitting `.e-con` entirely.
- **Non-Elementor builders emit a bare CTA text `<span></span>`** — the unreferenced `sytehero-hero-cta-text` class introduced in v1.0.052 has been dropped. The Elementor path continues to emit `.elementor-button-text` where the Elementor theme profile's host selector expects it.

### Added
- **Editor-script handle contract tests** — `HeroSliderBlockModuleTest` now directly asserts `editor_script_handle()` returns `'sytehero-hero-slider-editor-script'` and stays in lockstep with `BLOCK_NAME`. A `generate_block_asset_handle()` test stub in `tests/bootstrap.php` mirrors WP's real algorithm so both the live and fallback paths are covered.
- **Strengthened coexistence-test sentinel** — verifies via reflection that the three `DiviModuleRegistrarCoexistenceTest` future-contract methods still exist so a rename or accidental deletion trips a failing test immediately.

---

## v1.0.052 — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Scaffold decoupled from Elementor-specific class names.** The builder-scaffold renderer now emits `.e-con`, `.elementor-widget-container`, `.elementor-button`, and `.elementor-button-text` *only* for the Elementor widget path. Gutenberg / Avada / Divi / Divi 5 scaffolds produce clean, theme-neutral DOM — `.sytehero-hero-text-area-1`, `.sytehero-hero-text-area-2`, `.sytehero-hero-cta`, `.sytehero-hero-cta-text`. No frontend behaviour change (the overlay-injection JS's `el.closest(selector) || el` fallback continues to land text in our elements regardless).
- **Gutenberg block editor-script handle** is now computed dynamically via `generate_block_asset_handle()` instead of a hardcoded string — future-proof against WP's handle-generation algorithm changes.
- **Fusion Builder preview template** uses the underscore HTML-escape delimiter (`{{- }}` instead of `{{= }}`) for `data.sh_source` interpolation. Defensive escaping at the template boundary even though the field currently only carries sanitized dropdown values.

### Added
- **CI Node build step.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` now runs `npm ci` + `npm run build:all` between PHPUnit and the ZIP-staging step, so the release zip always contains freshly-built `assets/blocks/` and `assets/divi5/` rather than whatever was last committed.
- **Coming Soon placeholder contract tests** — asserts the Divi 5 placeholder row in Settings remains inert (no `TabGateOptions` key backing it) until the module actually ships.
- **Divi 4 ↔ Divi 5 coexistence contract tests** (deliberately skipped until the D5 module lands). Encodes the required short-circuit behaviour as a ready-made regression net for the future implementer.
- **Divi 5 stub bundle** emits a small runtime marker (`window.SyteHeroDivi5 = 'coming-soon'`, ~88 bytes) so WP caching/minify plugins don't treat the compiled file as corrupt.

### Notes
- An attempt to migrate from deprecated `divi-types-*` npm aliases to the direct `@divi/*` packages was reverted — the direct packages have a transitive dependency (`@types/codemirror@5.65.16`) that's missing from the npm registry, breaking fresh installs. Deferred to the Divi 5 native module continuation work; conditions for a successful re-attempt are documented.
- No runtime behaviour change on any of the four supported builders.

---

## v1.0.051 — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Divi 5 native module infrastructure (Coming Soon feature).** Build-time groundwork for a future first-class Divi 5 module — npm dependencies (`@divi/types` + targeted `@types/divi__*` packages), TypeScript + Webpack configs, a `build:divi5` script, and a stub `src/divi5/` source tree that compiles cleanly. The module implementation itself is deferred pending a green-light signal (customer demand, Divi 5 adoption threshold, or upstream `@divi/*` API stabilisation); see `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-divi5-module-continuation.md`.
- **"Divi 5 native module (Coming Soon)" placeholder** under *Settings → Advanced → Tab access*. Greyed out and non-interactive — marks where the real toggle will appear when the module ships.

### Changed
- Divi Classic module and Gutenberg block documentation now reference the Coming Soon Divi 5 roadmap.

### Notes
- No runtime behaviour changes on Divi 4 or Divi 5 sites. The Classic module from v1.0.049 continues to serve both (Divi 5 via its Classic-compatibility layer).
- Rolling back this release is safe: all additions are dev-only tooling + a disabled UI row; no new runtime code paths were introduced.

---

## v1.0.050 — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Fusion Builder element preview** — the SyteHero Hero Slider element now renders a labelled preview card inside Fusion Builder showing the element's name and selected source. Previously the builder showed only a generic element rectangle.

---

## v1.0.049 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Avada / Fusion Builder element: SyteHero Hero Slider** — register a native Fusion Builder element via `fusion_builder_map()` on `fusion_builder_before_init`. The element wraps a shortcode (`[sytehero_fusion_hero_slider]`) that reuses the shared scaffold subsystem introduced in v1.0.047, producing byte-identical frontend markup to the Elementor widget and Gutenberg block for equivalent attributes. Style tab exposes colour, font size, font weight, line height, and alignment per Text Area 1 / Text Area 2 / CTA, plus a layout gap.
- **Divi Classic module: SyteHero Hero Slider** — register a custom `ET_Builder_Module` subclass via `et_builder_ready`. Targets the classic back-end Divi Builder; the Visual Builder uses Divi's AJAX fallback rendering (a future release may add native VB rendering via a Divi Extension). Same Style-tab controls as the Fusion element.
- **Settings → Tab access toggles** — two new toggles (**Enable Fusion Builder element**, **Enable Divi module**) let admins hide each integration without affecting existing shortcode placements.

### Changed
- Bumped the shared scaffold subsystem's builder set to four: Elementor (v1.0.047), Gutenberg (v1.0.048), Avada / Fusion Builder, Divi Classic. Every builder consumes the same `Syte\Hero\Integrations\Scaffold\StyleSchema` + `ScaffoldRenderer` so authors see consistent behaviour across platforms.

---

## v1.0.048 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Gutenberg block: SyteHero Hero Slider** — insert the block on any post, page, or site-editor template and pick a saved hero from the Inspector. The overlay (Text Area 1, Text Area 2, CTA) is pre-packaged in the block's output; no container assembly required. Reuses the shared scaffold subsystem introduced in v1.0.047 so block placements produce the same frontend markup as the Elementor widget.
- **Inspector Style panels** — colour, font size, font weight, line height, and alignment per Text Area 1 / Text Area 2 / CTA, plus a layout gap control. Values cascade on top of the global SyteHero Settings defaults.
- **Settings → Tab access → Enable Gutenberg block** toggle — hides the block from the inserter without affecting existing shortcode placements.

### Changed
- **Minimum WordPress version** bumped to **5.8** (required for `block.json`-based block registration). Effectively no real-site impact; WP 5.0–5.7 is <1% of active sites per wordpress.org usage stats.
- **Build pipeline**: root `package.json` + `@wordpress/scripts` added for the Gutenberg block bundle. Dev-only — `src/`, `package.json`, `node_modules/` are excluded from the release zip by the existing allowlist. Built output ships from `assets/blocks/`.

---

## v1.0.047 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Pre-packaged overlay scaffold for the Elementor widget** — dropping the **SyteHero Hero Slider** widget onto a page now produces the Text Area 1, Text Area 2, and CTA overlay automatically. No separate Heading/Button widgets required and no CSS-class scaffolding to remember. Content still comes from *SyteHero → Custom Heroes* (or the Featured Products slider); empty source fields hide the matching overlay element.
- **Style tab on the Elementor widget** — per-placement controls for text colour, font size, font weight, line height, and alignment on each of Text Area 1, Text Area 2, and CTA, plus a layout "gap between elements" control. Values cascade on top of the global SyteHero Settings defaults.

### Changed
- **Shared scaffold subsystem** introduced under `Syte\Hero\Integrations\Scaffold` (`StyleSchema`, `StyleTokens`, `ScaffoldRenderer`). The Elementor widget is the first consumer; the Gutenberg block (v1.0.048) and Avada/Divi elements (v1.0.049) will reuse the same building blocks.

---

## v1.0.046 — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Elementor widget: SyteHero Hero Slider** — drop a "SyteHero Hero Slider" widget onto any Elementor page and pick either the Featured Products slider or a saved Custom Hero from a dropdown. Rotation, Text Area 1 / Text Area 2 / CTA overlays, license gating, and theme styling are inherited from the existing shortcode path, so there is no duplicate content to manage. Per-instance view variant (desktop/tablet/mobile) and an optional wrapper CSS class are exposed.
- **Settings → Tab access → Enable Elementor widgets** toggle — lets admins turn the widget off globally without affecting existing shortcode placements.

---

## v1.0.045 — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Fatal error on admin pages** — added missing `use` import for `AiProviderAjaxHandler` in `AdminJsConfig` after the AJAX namespace refactor. The class moved to `Admin\Ajax` but the reference was not updated, causing a fatal "Class not found" error on every admin page load.

---

## v1.0.044 — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Uniform hero height** — product, custom/page, and fallback slides now all render at the same configured height. Previously, custom slides with large images could push the hero beyond the set viewport height.
- **FlexSlider smoothHeight** — no longer fights the hero height constraint inside the slider background.
- **Supplemental slide auto-save** — editing text, margins, modes, or glow on custom/page slides now auto-saves via AJAX. Previously these changes were lost because the save was never triggered.
- **Push View persistence** — the Push View button now persists changes for supplemental and fallback hero text editors.

---

## v1.0.043 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Straico AI provider** — migrated from v1 API (which returned HTTP 522) to the OpenAI-compatible v2 API. Straico now uses the same request format as OpenAI and OpenRouter.
- **Straico model picker** — filters to chat models only, excluding image, video, and audio models from the text-provider dropdown.

### Changed
- **AI chat completion timeout** — increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds to accommodate slower LLM providers and aggregator services.
- **OpenAI-format token limit** — requests now send both `max_completion_tokens` and `max_tokens` for broad compatibility with OpenAI-compatible providers.

---

## v1.0.042 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Admin-bar launcher reliability** — removed a hard script dependency (`media-editor`) that could silently prevent the launcher from loading, causing admin-bar AI Studio items to stop responding to clicks.
- **Modal media picker diagnostics** — media picker guards now log a visible console warning when `wp.media` is unavailable, replacing the previous silent no-op.

### Changed
- **Launcher script hardening** — script loader now tracks already-loaded assets to prevent duplicates, scopes click handling to the admin bar, and logs errors on script load failure.

---

## v1.0.041 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **AI Studio admin-bar modals on every page** — Generate, Transform, Remove Background, Upscale, Extend to Fit, Image to Video, and AI Copy now work when launched from the admin bar on any admin page (Dashboard, Posts, Users, Plugins) or on the frontend for logged-in admins. Previously the modals opened but buttons inside were inert because their scripts didn't receive the full SyteHero config or the WordPress media picker.

### Changed
- **Admin-bar launcher moved to enqueued assets** — the launcher script and styles previously printed inline in each admin page now load from cacheable `sytehero-admin-bar-launcher.js` and `.css` files. No user-facing difference beyond slightly smaller page HTML.

---

## v1.0.040 — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **AI provider tokens-refresh button** — the refresh button next to **Max Tokens** on the AI Image provider card now syncs only the tokens value from the selected model. It no longer refetches the models list. If the models haven't been loaded yet, click **Refresh models** first.
- **Admin-bar AI modals** — modals launched from the top **SyteHero → AI Studio → [modal]** menu (AI Copy, BG Removal, Upscale, Outpaint, Image-to-Video) now render with the same styling as the AI Studio Generate modal. Previously, opening them outside the AI Studio page loaded only the base modal stylesheet, leaving drop zones and AI Copy-specific layout unstyled.

---

## v1.0.039 — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **AI Copy modal styling** — reference tiles, inputs, suggestion chips, and status states now use the same dark modal surface styling as the other AI Studio modals.
- **Transform modal footer layout** — action groups now keep a cleaner responsive structure as space tightens, with more consistent button alignment across desktop and mobile.

---

## v1.0.038 — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Prompt Enhancement** — now routes through the shared AI text-provider system. Fal is registered as a text provider so existing Fal-only setups keep working without any extra configuration. Saved Fal API keys carry over automatically.

### Removed
- **Legacy AI image shims** — `sytehero_fal_*` AJAX action aliases, the `sytehero_fal_settings` option, and the `FalAiSettings` / `get_fal_service` transitional helpers from the v1.0.036 AI provider refactor have been removed. Any integrations still calling the old names must update to `sytehero_ai_image_*`.

---

## v1.0.037 — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **AI Studio — Integrations tab** — AI image providers now render as separate card-style blocks with a shared save flow, making multi-provider configuration faster and less error-prone. Per-provider connection testing is preserved.
- **Documentation** — Integrations docs updated to describe the refreshed card layout and shared save workflow.

---

## v1.0.036 — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **AI Studio** — Fal AI is now implemented as the first adapter in a pluggable AI image/media provider system. Each capability (Generate, Transform, Remove BG, Upscale, Extend to Fit, Image-to-Video) can be independently routed to different providers. Existing Fal API key and settings migrate automatically on upgrade.
- **Prompt Enhancement** — now available as a function area on the Integrations tab; when configured with a text provider (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) prompts are enhanced via that provider instead of Fal's built-in model.

## v1.0.033 — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **AI Studio modal** — new dark-themed modal for text-to-image and image-to-image generation, accessible from any admin page
- **Admin bar launcher** — a ✨ icon in the WordPress admin bar opens the AI Studio modal from any admin screen without navigating to the AI Studio page
- **AI media manager** — dedicated AI Media tab to browse and delete AI-generated images, with usage detection to protect in-use assets

### Removed
- **Unused Media Scanner** — AI Studio's Tools tab and all underlying scan/delete/export functionality has been removed.

### Changed
- **Admin background** — Plugin admin pages now use a neutral slate-gray page canvas (#f8fafc) so white cards visually lift off the background.

### Fixed
- **Countdown modal save** — Clicking "Save Settings" in the countdown modal now immediately persists settings via AJAX. A second manual save of the schedule form is no longer required.
- **Analytics click tracking** — CTA clicks are now tracked at click time via a rate-limited AJAX beacon. Previously, "clicks" only recorded at completed checkout.

### Changed
- **AI Studio checkboxes** — Custom checkbox styling with proper checked state and focus indicator replaces the native browser rendering.
